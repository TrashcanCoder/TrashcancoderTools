## TrashcancoderTools Overview

TrashcancoderTools is in its early stages and does not yet have a definitive goal. 

New features are gradually being introduced, enhancing the tool's capabilities over time. The goal is to create tools that automate repetitive tasks and improve workflow efficiency.

Currently, TrashcancoderTools offers only basic utilities, but more features will be added soon to expand its potential.

### Note: The previous version displayed a simple usage message to demonstrate its basic functionality ;-).

However, it aims to evolve by providing unique solutions that developers need but may not have thought of.
